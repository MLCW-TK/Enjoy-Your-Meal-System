# Enjoy-Your-Meal-System
## What is this?
This is a software engineering project done in centralesupelec by Mathias Loh and Xiong Tiankai. Here, we have developed a minimalistic (but substantial) implementation of a software for restaurants to better handle their customers and orders using a simple command-line interface. 

## What else can be done?
A GUI interface can be implemented to better represent the methods underlined in this program. Extensive junit tests can be implemented as well, although the current version offers relatively rigorous checks on the methods provided.

## The future?
We have both decided to discontinue from this project, in pursue of other academic purposes. This project will remain open-source reference for those interested in basic software engineering techniques. We would greatly appreciate a mention / reference if this project do serve as a benchmark for future endeavours.

Good luck and have fun coding!
